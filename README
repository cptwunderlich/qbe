# About this fork

This fork implements stack canaries (or stack smashing protection),
in order to explore the concept.
The work was done for the course "Language based Security" at UT Vienna.

Most of the code is in emit.c, especially emitfn().
This is supposed to implement per-call random canaries.
Random canaries are generated for each function at startup and the
canary value gets xored with the return address on each call.
